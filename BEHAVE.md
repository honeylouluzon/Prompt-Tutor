STEP 1. Add additional task at TASK.md with series # followed by [TODO] before puting the instruction of your task  
(Example: 1. [TODO] Execute the content of the BEHAVE.MD)  
Step 2. Write a prompt in the github copilot instructing to perform the BEHAVE.md followed by the number of task at the TASK.md that you want to perform  
(Sample Prompt: "Execute the BEHAVE.md. ChosenTask = 1")
