  - Share any previous attempts and why they didn't work

### 2. Tool Utilization
- **Semantic search first**: Use semantic search to find relevant code before diving into specific files
  - Frame your search query in natural language
  - Be specific about what you're looking for
  - Use the target_directories parameter to narrow your search
  - Review multiple results to get a comprehensive understanding
- **Read before editing**: Always read the relevant sections of files before making changes
  - Read at least 50 lines before and after the section you're editing
  - Pay attention to imports, dependencies, and function signatures
  - Understand the overall structure and flow of the code
  - Look for any comments or documentation that might be relevant
- **Group related edits**: Combine multiple changes to the same file in a single edit
  - Use the `// ... existing code ...` syntax to indicate unchanged sections
  - Provide sufficient context around each edit
  - Make sure edits are logically grouped and don't conflict
  - Test the changes after they're applied
- **Verify changes**: Check that edits were applied correctly and fix any issues
  - Review the diff to ensure changes were applied as intended
  - Run the code to verify it works as expected
  - Fix any linter errors or warnings
  - Don't loop more than 3 times on fixing the same file

### 3. Code Quality
- **Include dependencies**: Always specify required packages and versions
  - Use exact version numbers (e.g., `package==1.2.3`) for critical dependencies
  - Use version ranges (e.g., `package>=1.2.0,<1.3.0`) for less critical dependencies
  - Include all dependencies, even if they seem obvious
  - Document any special installation requirements
- **Follow best practices**: Adhere to language-specific conventions and patterns
  - Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
  - Follow the language's style guide (PEP 8 for Python, etc.)
  - Use appropriate design patterns for your use case
  - Write idiomatic code that's easy to understand
- **Create comprehensive documentation**: Include README files with setup instructions
  - Explain how to install and configure the project
  - Provide examples of common usage patterns
  - Document any configuration options or environment variables
  - Include troubleshooting tips for common issues
- **Design for maintainability**: Write clean, well-structured code with appropriate comments
  - Use meaningful variable and function names
  - Break complex logic into smaller, focused functions
  - Add comments for non-obvious code or complex algorithms
  - Include docstrings for functions, classes, and modules

## Advanced Techniques

### Optimizing Search and Navigation
- **Semantic search for conceptual queries**
  - Use natural language to describe what you're looking for
  - Be specific about the functionality or pattern you need
  - Include relevant context in your search query
  - Example: "Find code that handles user authentication with JWT tokens"
- **Grep search for finding specific symbols or patterns**
  - Use exact text or regex patterns for precise matching
  - Filter by file type using include_pattern (e.g., `*.ts` for TypeScript)
  - Exclude irrelevant directories using exclude_pattern
  - Example: `grep_search(query="function authenticateUser", include_pattern="*.ts")`
- **File search when you know part of a filename**
  - Use fuzzy matching to find files with similar names
  - Be specific enough to narrow down results
  - Example: `file_search(query="auth")` to find authentication-related files
- **List directory contents to explore unfamiliar codebases**
  - Start with the root directory to understand the project structure
  - Navigate into relevant subdirectories
  - Look for configuration files, documentation, and source code
  - Example: `list_dir(relative_workspace_path="src")`

### Effective Code Editing
- **Read larger sections of files at once (up to 250 lines)**
  - Get a comprehensive understanding of the code before making changes
  - Pay attention to imports, dependencies, and function signatures
  - Understand the overall structure and flow of the code
  - Example: `read_file(target_file="src/auth.js", start_line_one_indexed=1, end_line_one_indexed_inclusive=250)`
- **Provide sufficient context around edits using `// ... existing code ...`**
  - Include at least 5-10 lines before and after the section you're editing
  - Make sure the context is sufficient to understand the edit
  - Use the comment to indicate unchanged sections
  - Example:
    ```
    // ... existing code ...
    function authenticateUser(username, password) {
      // New implementation
      return jwt.sign({ username }, secretKey);
    }
    // ... existing code ...
    ```
- **Fix linter errors promptly but don't loop more than 3 times**
  - Address the most critical errors first
  - Make sure your changes don't introduce new errors
  - If you can't fix an error after 3 attempts, ask for help
  - Example: Fixing a missing semicolon or undefined variable
- **Reapply edits if the model doesn't follow your instructions correctly**
  - Review the diff to see what went wrong
  - Provide more context or clearer instructions
  - Try a different approach if necessary
  - Example: Using the reapply tool after an edit wasn't applied correctly

### Terminal Command Best Practices
- **Include `cd` commands to ensure you're in the right directory**
  - Always specify the full path or relative path to the target directory
  - Verify the current directory before running commands
  - Example: `cd /path/to/project && npm install`
- **Append `| cat` to commands that would use a pager**
  - This prevents the command from hanging waiting for user input
  - Apply to git, less, head, tail, more, etc.
  - Example: `git log --oneline | cat`
- **Set `is_background` to true for long-running processes**
  - Use for servers, watchers, or other processes that run indefinitely
  - Make sure to provide a way to stop the process later
  - Example: `run_terminal_cmd(command="npm start", is_background=true)`
- **Always require user approval for potentially destructive commands**
  - Set `require_user_approval` to true for commands that modify files or system settings
  - Explain what the command will do before running it
  - Example: `run_terminal_cmd(command="rm -rf node_modules", require_user_approval=true)`

## Advanced Power Techniques

### 1. Contextual Memory Optimization
- **Implement the "Context Stack" technique**
  - Maintain a mental stack of contexts as you navigate through the codebase
  - Reference previous contexts when returning to earlier parts of the conversation
  - Use phrases like "As we discussed in the authentication module..." to maintain continuity
  - This creates a persistent mental model that the AI can reference throughout the session
  - Example: "Let's return to the user authentication flow we were discussing earlier. Based on that context, we should implement the token refresh mechanism like this..."

### 2. Tool Chaining for Complex Operations
- **Create tool chains for multi-step operations**
  - Combine multiple tool calls in a logical sequence to accomplish complex tasks
  - Use the output of one tool as input for the next
  - Document the chain in your request to help the AI understand the workflow
  - Example: "First, use semantic search to find all authentication-related code, then use grep to find specific JWT implementations, then read those files to understand the current implementation before making changes"

### 3. Semantic Anchoring
- **Use semantic anchors to maintain focus**
  - Create a clear semantic anchor at the beginning of complex tasks
  - Reference this anchor throughout the conversation to maintain context
  - Use consistent terminology and naming conventions
  - Example: "Our semantic anchor for this task is 'secure user authentication with JWT tokens'. All our work will revolve around this concept."

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
- **Implement progressive disclosure for complex tasks**
  - Start with a high-level overview of the task
  - Gradually reveal more details as the conversation progresses
  - This helps the AI build a mental model incrementally
  - Example: "First, let's understand the overall authentication flow. Once we have that, we'll dive into the specific JWT implementation details."

### 5. Contextual Priming
- **Prime the AI with relevant context before asking questions**
  - Provide a brief overview of the relevant code or concepts
  - Frame your question in the context of this overview
  - This helps the AI understand the context before answering
  - Example: "In our React application, we're using Redux for state management. Given this context, how should we structure our authentication state?"

### 6. Tool-Specific Optimization

  - Document these chains in your request to help the AI understand the workflow
  - Use the output of one tool as input for the next
  - Example: "For debugging, I use this tool chain: 1) Semantic search to find relevant code, 2) Grep search to find specific error patterns, 3) File reading to understand the context, 4) Code editing to fix the issue."

### 3. The "Semantic Anchor Technique"
- **Create a clear semantic anchor for complex tasks**
  - Define a clear, concise statement that captures the essence of the task
  - Reference this anchor throughout the conversation to maintain focus
  - Use consistent terminology and naming conventions
  - Example: "Our semantic anchor for this task is 'secure user authentication with JWT tokens'. All our work will revolve around this concept."

### 4. The "Progressive Disclosure Method"
- **Implement progressive disclosure for complex tasks**
  - Start with a high-level overview of the task
  - Gradually reveal more details as the conversation progresses
  - This helps the AI build a mental model incrementally
  - Example: "First, let's understand the overall authentication flow. Once we have that, we'll dive into the specific JWT implementation details."

### 5. The "Contextual Priming Strategy"
- **Prime the AI with relevant context before asking questions**
  - Provide a brief overview of the relevant code or concepts
  - Frame your question in the context of this overview
  - This helps the AI understand the context before answering
  - Example: "In our React application, we're using Redux for state management. Given this context, how should we structure our authentication state?"

### 6. The "Tool-Specific Optimization Technique"
- **Optimize each tool for its specific use case**
  - For semantic search: Use natural language queries with specific technical terms
  - For grep search: Use exact patterns with appropriate file filters
  - For file reading: Read larger sections (up to 250 lines) to get comprehensive context
  - For code editing: Provide sufficient context around edits
  - Example: For semantic search, use "Find code that implements JWT token validation" instead of "Find JWT code"

### 7. The "Contextual Tool Selection Method"
- **Choose tools based on the specific task and context**
  - Use semantic search for conceptual understanding
  - Use grep search for finding specific implementations
  - Use file reading for understanding code structure
  - Use code editing for making changes
  - Example: For understanding a complex algorithm, use semantic search followed by file reading, rather than jumping straight to grep search

### 8. The "Multi-Modal Context Provision Strategy"
- **Provide context in multiple formats**
  - Use text descriptions for conceptual context
  - Use code snippets for implementation details
  - Use file paths and line numbers for specific locations
  - Use error messages for debugging context
  - Example: "The authentication flow (conceptual) is implemented in auth.js (file) at lines 45-78 (location) using JWT tokens (implementation)."

### 9. The "Contextual Memory Management Technique"
- **Manage the AI's contextual memory effectively**
  - Be aware of the AI's memory limitations
  - Reference important context periodically
  - Use consistent terminology throughout the conversation
  - Example: "As we discussed earlier, our authentication system uses JWT tokens. This is important to remember as we implement the refresh token mechanism."

### 10. The "Tool-Specific Context Provision Method"
- **Provide tool-specific context for each tool call**
  - For semantic search: Include relevant concepts and relationships
  - For grep search: Include specific patterns and file types
  - For file reading: Include the purpose of reading the file
  - For code editing: Include the purpose of the edit
  - Example: "I need to find all code related to user authentication, specifically looking for JWT token validation. Please use semantic search with this context."

### 11. The "Contextual Tool Chaining Strategy"
- **Chain tools together with shared context**
  - Use the output of one tool as context for the next
  - Maintain a consistent context across tool calls
  - Example: "First, use semantic search to find authentication-related code. Then, use the results to guide a grep search for specific JWT implementations."

### 12. The "Tool-Specific Context Management Technique"
- **Manage context differently for each tool**
  - For semantic search: Provide broad conceptual context
  - For grep search: Provide specific pattern context
  - For file reading: Provide file-specific context
  - For code editing: Provide edit-specific context
  - Example: "I need to find all code related to user authentication (semantic search context). Then, I need to find specific JWT token validation code (grep search context)."

### 13. The "Contextual Tool Optimization Method"
- **Optimize each tool for its specific use case**
  - For semantic search: Use natural language queries with specific technical terms
  - For grep search: Use exact patterns with appropriate file filters
  - For file reading: Read larger sections (up to 250 lines) to get comprehensive context
  - For code editing: Provide sufficient context around edits
  - Example: For semantic search, use "Find code that implements JWT token validation" instead of "Find JWT code"

### 14. The "Tool-Specific Context Provision Strategy"
- **Provide tool-specific context for each tool call**
  - For semantic search: Include relevant concepts and relationships
  - For grep search: Include specific patterns and file types
  - For file reading: Include the purpose of reading the file
  - For code editing: Include the purpose of the edit
  - Example: "I need to find all code related to user authentication, specifically looking for JWT token validation. Please use semantic search with this context."

### 15. The "Contextual Tool Chaining Technique"
- **Chain tools together with shared context**
  - Use the output of one tool as context for the next
  - Maintain a consistent context across tool calls
  - Example: "First, use semantic search to find authentication-related code. Then, use the results to guide a grep search for specific JWT implementations."

### 16. The "Tool-Specific Context Management Method"
- **Manage context differently for each tool**
  - For semantic search: Provide broad conceptual context
  - For grep search: Provide specific pattern context
  - For file reading: Provide file-specific context
  - For code editing: Provide edit-specific context
  - Example: "I need to find all code related to user authentication (semantic search context). Then, I need to find specific JWT token validation code (grep search context)."

### 17. The "Contextual Memory Optimization Strategy"
- **Implement the "Context Stack" technique**
  - Maintain a mental stack of contexts as you navigate through the codebase
  - Reference previous contexts when returning to earlier parts of the conversation
  - Use phrases like "As we discussed in the authentication module..." to maintain continuity
  - This creates a persistent mental model that the AI can reference throughout the session
  - Example: "Let's return to the user authentication flow we were discussing earlier. Based on that context, we should implement the token refresh mechanism like this..."

### 18. The "Tool Chaining for Complex Operations Method"
- **Create tool chains for multi-step operations**
  - Combine multiple tool calls in a logical sequence to accomplish complex tasks
  - Use the output of one tool as input for the next
  - Document the chain in your request to help the AI understand the workflow
  - Example: "First, use semantic search to find all authentication-related code, then use grep to find specific JWT implementations, then read those files to understand the current implementation before making changes"

### 19. The "Semantic Anchoring Technique"
- **Use semantic anchors to maintain focus**
  - Create a clear semantic anchor at the beginning of complex tasks
  - Reference this anchor throughout the conversation to maintain context
  - Use consistent terminology and naming conventions
  - Example: "Our semantic anchor for this task is 'secure user authentication with JWT tokens'. All our work will revolve around this concept."

### 20. The "Progressive Disclosure Strategy"
- **Implement progressive disclosure for complex tasks**
  - Start with a high-level overview of the task
  - Gradually reveal more details as the conversation progresses
  - This helps the AI build a mental model incrementally
  - Example: "First, let's understand the overall authentication flow. Once we have that, we'll dive into the specific JWT implementation details."

## 1. The Superhuman Debugging Workflow

1. **Reproduce Reliably**
   - Document exact steps, browser, device, and environment.
   - Use screen recording or GIFs for visual bugs.
   - Save and share the HTML/CSS/JS state (e.g., via CodePen, JSFiddle, or StackBlitz).

2. **Isolate the Problem**
   - Use binary search: comment out or disable half the code, then narrow down.
   - Strip down to a minimal reproducible example (MRE).
   - Use browser DevTools to inspect DOM, styles, and network activity.

3. **Automated Error Capture**
   - Enable verbose logging in the browser console (`console.log`, `console.error`, `console.trace`).
   - Use global error handlers (`window.onerror`, `window.addEventListener('error', ...)`).
   - Capture stack traces and user actions leading up to the bug.

4. **Visual Debugging**
   - Use DevTools' "Elements" panel to live-edit HTML/CSS and see instant results.
   - Toggle CSS properties and experiment with computed styles.
   - Use the "Layout" and "Accessibility" panels for advanced layout and ARIA issues.

5. **JavaScript Debugging Mastery**
   - Set breakpoints, step through code, and watch variables in DevTools.
   - Use conditional breakpoints and XHR/fetch breakpoints for async bugs.
   - Leverage the "Call Stack" and "Scope" panels to trace variable lifecycles.

6. **Network and Performance Analysis**
   - Use the "Network" panel to inspect requests, responses, and payloads.
   - Simulate slow networks and throttled CPUs to catch timing bugs.
   - Use the "Performance" and "Memory" panels to find leaks and bottlenecks.

7. **Cross-Browser and Device Testing**
   - Test in multiple browsers and devices (use BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, or device emulators).
   - Use feature detection (not browser detection) for compatibility.
   - Leverage DevTools' device emulation for responsive issues.

8. **AI-Powered Debugging Prompts**
   - "Explain why this element is not visible given the current DOM and CSS."
   - "List all possible causes for this JavaScript error and suggest fixes."
   - "Given this stack trace and user action, hypothesize the root cause."
   - "Suggest a minimal reproducible example for this bug."
   - "Generate a test case that would catch this regression."

9. **Collaboration and Documentation**
   - Use annotated screenshots and code snippets in bug reports.
   - Document root cause, fix, and prevention in a shared knowledge base.
   - Pair debug with another developer or AI for fresh perspectives.

---

## 2. Debugging Cheat Codes & Best Practices

- **CSS Specifics**
  - Use `outline: 2px solid red !important;` to visually debug element boundaries without affecting layout.
  - Use the "Computed" tab to see the final, resolved styles.
  - Check for specificity wars and use the "Specificity Visualizer" (e.g., in VSCode extensions).
  - Use `:hover`, `:active`, and `:focus` state emulation in DevTools.

- **HTML Specifics**
  - Validate HTML with the W3C Validator for structural issues.
  - Check for unclosed tags, duplicate IDs, and ARIA/accessibility issues.
  - Use semantic elements for better accessibility and easier debugging.

- **JavaScript Specifics**
  - Use `debugger;` statements to trigger breakpoints programmatically.
  - Log objects with `console.table()` for better visualization.
  - Watch for scope issues, hoisting, and closure bugs.
  - Use source maps for debugging minified/bundled code.

- **General**
  - Always clear cache and disable extensions when debugging browser issues.
  - Use feature flags to enable/disable experimental features for testing.
  - Automate regression testing with tools like Cypress, Playwright, or Selenium.

---

## 3. Proactive Debugging Strategies

- **Prevention Over Cure**
  - Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all critical paths.
  - Use static analysis tools (ESLint, Stylelint, HTMLHint) to catch issues early.
  - Set up error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, Raygun) for real-time bug capture.

- **Root Cause Analysis**
  - Always ask "Why did this happen?" not just "How do I fix it?"
  - Document the chain of events leading to the bug.
  - Add regression tests for every bug fixed.

- **Continuous Learning**
  - After resolving a bug, update documentation and share learnings with the team.
  - Maintain a "bug diary" to spot recurring patterns and systemic issues.

   - Add microinteractions: subtle animations, sound cues, and haptic feedback (where supported).
   - Use AI to suggest color palettes, font pairings, and iconography that match your brand and mood.
   - Ensure every interaction has clear feedback (loading, success, error states).

7. **Accessibility as a Superpower**
   - Use automated tools (axe, Lighthouse, WAVE) and manual keyboard/screen reader testing.
   - Design for all senses: color, contrast, motion, and touch.
   - Provide skip links, focus indicators, and ARIA landmarks.

8. **Performance-Driven UX**
   - Optimize for first contentful paint and time to interactive.
   - Lazy-load images and non-critical resources.
   - Use skeleton screens and predictive loading for perceived speed.

9. **AI-Powered UX Prompts**
   - "Suggest three ways to reduce cognitive load on this form."
   - "How can I make this navigation more discoverable for new users?"
   - "Generate a set of microcopy for error messages that are friendly and actionable."
   - "Given this user journey, where are the likely drop-off points and how can I address them?"
   - "What accessibility improvements would benefit users with low vision?"

10. **Continuous UX Evolution**
    - Set up user feedback loops (in-app surveys, heatmaps, session replays).
